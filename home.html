          <h2>ReactJS</h2>
            <p>
              React is a JavaScript library that is used for building good-looking and functional user interfaces. It was 
              developed by Facebook and is still maintained by Facebook developers. React uses code snippets called components 
              to build a larger application. The components can be anything from a text-box to a modal window to a navigation bar. 
              In React these components are all built in different places and then used in the final app. The benefit is that the 
              components are reusable. If a developer is working on a list which will display in 100 boxes on a web page, they only 
              need to write one component for the “Box” and import it to their project, pass the relevant properties (props) in 
              and React will do the rest.
              <br><br>
              React also uses a feature call state. State is a JavaScript object which contains working information that might be 
              updated regularly. One of the coolest things about React is that it keeps an eye on the DOM and also keeps a virtual 
              DOM, when it senses changes to the DOM, it re-renders the page, but only the objects that have changed. It’s quick and 
              efficient.
              <br><br>
              In React we use a modified HTML-like code called JSX. All of our components are written in JavaScript, but they are 
              implemented in JSX which looks similar to HTML with some minor changes. 
            </p>

              <h4><u>React City Ranker App</u></h4>
              Take a look at my first React app. Its a city population comparison app. I wrote a list of the largest cities in the world, 
              by population (see below for the SQL and CSV), exported it into JSON and used that as a component for my app. Punch your 
              population in and see where it compares to the top cities in the world.

          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <p>JavaScript is one of the most used languages in the world. It's highly versatile and it integrates 
            well with browsers, HTML and CSS. JavaScript is my favorite language as a front-end developer. Below are some
            of my JavaScript projects.

            <h4><u>Birthday/Age Calculator</u></h4>
            This program prompts the user for a birth
            year, month and day. It then uses JavaScript to take the current date, compare the difference and write it in the 
            HTML. The program calculates for different days of corresponding months (31, 30 and 28) and does some math to 
            display the output in a format that makes sense to the way we keep track of time (1 year and 2 months instead of 2 
            years and -10 months).

            <h4><u>To Do List</u></h4>
            The To Do List uses home-made functions which make use of the built in methods of shift and push in
            JavaScript. I've created a variable which is an array that simply displays the list. The push method
            is used to add the item in the prompt to the array and the shift method removes the first item in the 
            array. There are event listeners that update the page once the user makes a change to the list.

            I love the Office...not my current sales job, the TV show. I designed this soundboard to provide minutes of 
            entertainment to any fellow fans of the show. Credit to Wes Bos; the format is similar to his first challenge
            on the 30 day JavaScript Challenge. Aside from the different formatting 
            and differed code, I designed mine to work with a keyboard button push or by clicking on the buttons, which Wes' 
            version does not do. Enjoy!

            This app uses a list of JavaScript objects with information about the presidents. The user can enter a number which 
            retrieves the corresponding president's information and displays it in the HTML.

            <h4><u>jQuery Animation Example</u></h4>
            Animations can really set your website apart from the others. jQuery uses a pre-made library to allow shorthand 
            access to complex code sets. The fade in effect on this page is made by using jQuery. This example is from 
            a previous version of my page and hides elements, exposing them when a user clicks a button. The page also scrolls
            to the clicked item.

        <h2>WordPress</h2>
          <p>
            WordPress is a website that has an easy to use editor, pre-made themes and allows for plugins for advanced features. 
            If you can make a PowerPoint slide, you can make a web page using WordPress. WordPress is more basic than writing a 
            site from scratch, and for the free version will place ads and pop-ups on your page, but for the average user who is 
            not able to code, WordPress works great. This is probably one reason that WordPress accounts for about 1/3 of all websites. 
            That’s 1/3 of all websites on the entire internet. That makes WordPress a great technology to learn and know.

        <h2>SQL</h2>
          <p>SQL, or Structured Query Language, was created in 1974 and is still used today to create, modify, add and
            remove data from databases. The importance of having the right tools to navigate information 
            is essential to anyone looking to make use of this vast resource. The amount of data globally grows exponentially
            every year and companies like Facebook and Google make millions from studying and distributing this information. With 
            enough information and the right tools, you can harness the power of data. Financial companies
            make market predictions, farmers can predict weather patterns and governments can predict elections. Data 
            is pretty powerful stuff and SQL is key in using it.
            <br><br>
            Complements to SQL like Tableau and MySQL allow intuitive presentation and access of data. Here is a link to
            some SQL queries I wrote in MySQL for a Zombie Status Report. The database includes
            two tables which are modified, joined and more.

            I love data. My best friend and I used to Wikipedia lists of top-100's. We'd search for lists of the largest airports
            in the world, or the largest countries by surface area. One of my favorites was largest cities in the world by population. 
            So I created a database in MySQL and a table inside containing the top cities in the world by population. Check out my SQL 
            code below to see exactly how I did it. Check out the CSV file below to see what I created with this code.

          <h2>PHP</h2>
          <p>PHP is a server side scripting language that can be used as a general programming language. My knowledge of PHP
            is fairly basic, but a good programmer knows how to make use of any type of code. My Contact page is an HTML
            file that has a few basic text boxes. I've used a PHP template and modified it to integrate with my HTML
            page. The PHP file validates the data and takes the user to an error page if there are any issues. If the data
            entered meets the parameters the PHP file uses a web service to format the info and send it to my Gmail account.

          <h2>Bootstrap</h2>
          <p>The Bootstrap Framework is a collection of JavaScript and CSS files, usually loaded externally,
            that includes thousands of preloaded tools a front-end web developer can make use of. Given the 
            wide range of devices that people use to view websites and the screen size ranges, Bootstrap
            automatically comfigures the screen and HTML elements to best fit a computer, tablet or smart phone.
            Because of this, a majority of professionally designed websites employ the Bootstrap Framework.
            In fact, the website you are on right now is running on the Bootstrap Framework.
            <br><br>
            Bootstrap is a front-end tool and is free and easy to use. Take a look at a simple Bootstrap page I've
            created using a template from W3 Schools. Try this link on different devices and watch how Bootstrap
            re-formats the content. Click here to see my Bootstrap Framework Example:

            Here's a fun bootstrap project. The project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and 
            Bootstrap to prompt a user for thier name in a modal window, then greet them accordingly. The JavaScript checks
            for errors such as an empty submission, or a name containing numbers, and gives the user an error message if either
            is detected. Enjoy!

          <h2>C# & .NET</h2>
          <p>C# is a powerful programming language adapted by Microsoft from the C programming language. It was
            developed around 2000 within Microsoft's .NET Framework. C# is a true object oriented programming language
            and uses methods, loops, variables, objects, etc. My C# and .NET experience is more limited than my JavaScript
            experience, but here is a quick demo project I've built to demonstrate my understanding of the language.
            <br><br>
            The following program is a fitness app that runs in the terminal of any .NET compatible software. It prompts the 
            user for workout information, error checks data, and responds to the user based on the level of activity. The 
            program will track your activity until you exit. 
            <br><br>
            To run FitnessFrog extract the zip file and place them files inside it in the same folder. Download an IDE (I recommend
            Visaul Studio Code from Microsoft) and open the folder in the IDE. Right click the folder and select
            "Open in Terminal". After that just type "dotnet run" in the terminal and press enter. Have fun and happy sweating.
