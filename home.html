              <h4><u>React City Ranker App</u></h4>
              Take a look at my first React app. Its a city population comparison app. I wrote a list of the largest cities in the world, 
              by population (see below for the SQL and CSV), exported it into JSON and used that as a component for my app. Punch your 
              population in and see where it compares to the top cities in the world.

              <h4><u>React Burger Builder</u></h4>
              This is an app developed off of a React course on Udemy. It would link to a payment and ordering system in the real 
              world, but for the sake of building a burger and dynamically displaying it, the app functions. This project uses an entire 
              list of home-made components, dynamic styles and many other advanced React features.

            <h4><u>Birthday/Age Calculator</u></h4>
            This program prompts the user for a birth
            year, month and day. It then uses JavaScript to take the current date, compare the difference and write it in the 
            HTML. The program calculates for different days of corresponding months (31, 30 and 28) and does some math to 
            display the output in a format that makes sense to the way we keep track of time (1 year and 2 months instead of 2 
            years and -10 months).

            <h4><u>To Do List</u></h4>
            The To Do List uses home-made functions which make use of the built in methods of shift and push in
            JavaScript. I've created a variable which is an array that simply displays the list. The push method
            is used to add the item in the prompt to the array and the shift method removes the first item in the 
            array. There are event listeners that update the page once the user makes a change to the list.

            <h4><u>The Office Soundboard</u></h4>
            I designed this soundboard to provide minutes of 
            entertainment to any fellow fans of the show. Credit to Wes Bos; the format is similar to his first challenge
            on the 30 day JavaScript Challenge. Aside from the different formatting 
            and differed code, I designed mine to work with a keyboard button push or by clicking on the buttons, which Wes' 
            version does not do. Enjoy!

            <h4><u>Presidents of the United States of America</u></h4>
            This app uses a list of JavaScript objects with information about the presidents. The user can enter a number which 
            retrieves the corresponding president's information and displays it in the HTML.

            <h4><u>jQuery Animation</u></h4>
            jQuery uses a pre-made library to allow shorthand 
            access to complex code sets. The fade in effect on this page is made by using jQuery. This example is from 
            a previous version of my page and hides elements, exposing them when a user clicks a button. The page also scrolls
            to the clicked item.

          <p>
            Here is a link to
            some SQL queries I wrote in MySQL for a Zombie Status Report. The database includes
            two tables which are modified, joined and more.

          <p>
            I love data. My best friend and I used to Wikipedia lists of top-100's. We'd search for lists of the largest airports
            in the world, or the largest countries by surface area. One of my favorites was largest cities in the world by population. 
            So I created a database in MySQL and a table inside containing the top cities in the world by population. Check out my SQL 
            code below to see exactly how I did it. Check out the CSV file below to see what I created with this code.

          <h2>PHP</h2>
          <br>
          <p>PHP is a server side scripting language that can be used as a general programming language. My knowledge of PHP
            is fairly basic, but a good programmer knows how to make use of any type of code. My Contact page is an HTML
            file that has a few basic text boxes. I've used a PHP template and modified it to integrate with my HTML
            page. The PHP file validates the data and takes the user to an error page if there are any issues. If the data
            entered meets the parameters the PHP file uses a web service to format the info and send it to my Gmail account. 
            Try it out and give me some feedback on the site.

            Here's a fun bootstrap project. The project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and 
            Bootstrap to prompt a user for thier name in a modal window, then greet them accordingly. The JavaScript checks
            for errors such as an empty submission, or a name containing numbers, and gives the user an error message if either
            is detected.

            A fun, and simple C# project I made.
            To run FitnessFrog extract the zip file and place the files inside it in the same folder. Download an IDE (I recommend
            Visaul Studio Code from Microsoft) and open the folder in the IDE. Right click the folder and select
            "Open in Terminal". After that just type "dotnet run" in the terminal and press enter. Have fun and happy sweating.
