          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <p>JavaScript is one of the most used languages in the world. Highly versatile as a pseudo-object
            oriented programming (OOP) language, it integrates well with browsers and loves HTML and CSS, the code
            languages that make up the content and style of a web page. 
            <br><br>
            JavaScript works well to calculate numbers and display information on dynamic web pages. Instead
            of me telling you, take a look at a program I wrote that does just that. Click here to see my 
            <a href="pages/birthday.html" target="new"><h4>Birthday/Age Calculator</h4></a>
          
            The Birthday/Age Calculator took more work than might meet the eye. For example, one might think 
            that by simply subtracting dates from a current date we get a working program. Unfortunately if that 
            was the case a person who was born on January 20, 2000, running the program on January 19, 2018, 
            would be shown as 18 years, 0 months and -1 days old. To correct this issue I used a series of
            if/else statements which exchange the equivalent amount of time (-1 year for +12 months) 
            when necessary. I even coded it to determine the current month and created
            if/else statements to trade the correct number of days for months containing 31, 30 and 28 days. Don't 
            use it on February 29th on a leap year or your computer will explode.
          </p>
          <p>Enough Games! We have work to do, and that is why you need someone like me to help you do it. Let's
            take a look at another program I wrote that will help us with that. I call 
            it...the To Do List, I've always prided myself on originality. Click here to see my
            <a href="pages/toDoList.html" target="new"><h4>To Do List</h4></a>
                 
            The To Do List uses home-made functions which make use of the built in methods of shift and push in
            JavaScript. I've created a variable which is an array that simply displays the list. The push method
            is used to add the item in the prompt to the array and the shift method removes the first item in the 
            array.
          </p>
          <p>I love the Office...not my current sales job, the TV show. I designed this soundboard to provide minutes of 
            entertainment to any fellow fans of the show. Credit to Wes Bos; the format is similar to his first challenge
            on the 30 day JavaScript Challenge. Aside from the different formatting 
            and differed code, I designed mine to work with a keyboard button push or by clicking on the buttons, which Wes' 
            version does not do. Enjoy!

            New Clock that I made based off of Wes Bos' Project, but this one was done a liitle differently:

            Looking to get more experience with JavaScript objects, I sought out a project where I could use an array of 
            objects and return corresponding data in response to user prompts. I’m a huge history nerd, so a presidential 
            database with terms and names seemed fitting. Take a look. Just plug in a number (obviously between 1 and 45) 
            and you’ll get some info on that president.

          <h2>jQuery</h2>
          <p>Animations can really set your website apart from the others. jQuery is the most widely used JavaScript
            library and is great for animations amongst other things. JavaScript libraries are sections of prewritten
            code that can be called with simplified commands. John Resig created jQuery in 2006 and it is still heavily
            used today. If you like the fade-in effect on this page you will be a fan of jQuery.
            Here's another look at some code that I put together to demonstrate jQuery's abilities:

        <h2>SQL</h2>
          <p>SQL, or Structured Query Language, was created in 1974 and is still used today to create, modify, add and
            remove data from databases. The importance of being able to navigate information in today's marketplace
            is essential to anyone looking to make use of this vast resource. Not to mention data grows exponentially
            and companies like Facebook and Google make millions from studying and distributing this information. With 
            enough information and the right know-how, you can learn almost anything. Financial companies
            make market predictions, farmers can predict weather patterns and governments can predict elections. Data 
            is pretty powerful stuff and SQL is key in using it.
            <br><br>
            Complements to SQL like Tableau and MySQL allow intuitive presentation and access of data. Here is a link to
            some SQL queries I wrote for a Zombie Status Report project in one of my bootcamps. The database includes
            two tables which are modified and joined, and more. This isn't a working database, just a sample of some SQL code
            I wrote for the project. Check out the entire repository and the finished project on my GitHub page.

          <h2>PHP</h2>
          <p>PHP is a server side scripting language that can be used as a general programming language. My knowledge of PHP
            is fairly basic, but a good programmer knows how to make use of any type of code. My Contact page is an HTML
            file that has a few basic text boxes. I've used a PHP template and modified it to integrate with my HTML
            page. The PHP file validates the data and takes the user to an error page if there are any issues. If the data
            entered meets the parameters the PHP file uses a web service to format the info and send it to my Gmail account. 
            Try it out and give me some feedback on the site. <a href="pages/contact.html" target="new"><h4>Contact Me Page</h4></a>

          <h2>Bootstrap</h2>
          <p>The Bootstrap Framework is a collection of JavaScript and CSS files, usually loaded externally,
            that includes thousands of preloaded tools a front-end web developer can make use of. Given the 
            wide range of devices that people use to view websites and the screen size ranges, Bootstrap
            automatically comfigures the screen and HTML elements to best fit a computer, tablet or smart phone.
            Because of this, a majority of professionally designed websites employ the Bootstrap Framework.
            In fact, the website you are on right now is running on the Bootstrap Framework.
            <br><br>
            Bootstrap is a front-end tool and is free and easy to use. Take a look at a simple Bootstrap page I've
            created using a template from W3 Schools. Try this link on different devices and watch how Bootstrap
            re-formats the content. Click here to see my Bootstrap Framework Example:

            <br><br>
            Here's another quick project I had to whip up for an interview. The project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and 
            Bootstrap to prompt a user for thier name in a modal window, then greet them accordingly. The JavaScript checks
            for errors such as an empty submission, or a name containing numbers, and gives the user an error message if either
            is detected. Enjoy!

          <h2>C# & .NET</h2>
          <p>C# is a powerful programming language adapted by Microsoft from the C programming language. It was
            developed around 2000 within Microsoft's .NET Framework. C# is a true object oriented programming language
            and uses methods, loops, variables, objects, etc. My C# and .NET experience is more limited than my JavaScript
            experience, but here is a quick demo project I've built to demonstrate my understanding of the language.
            <br><br>
            The following program is a fitness app that runs in the terminal of any .NET compatible software. It prompts the 
            user for workout information, error checks data, and responds to the user based on the level of activity. The 
            program will track your activity until you exit. 
            <br><br>
            To run FitnessFrog extract the zip file and place them files inside it in the same folder. Download an IDE (I recommend
            Visaul Studio Code from Microsoft) and open the folder in the IDE. Right click the folder and select
            "Open in Terminal". After that just type "dotnet run" in the terminal and press enter. Have fun and happy sweating.
