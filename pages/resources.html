            <h1>Must Have Resources</h1><br>
            <p>
                A big part of me growing as a developer is to help younger developers in thier quest for the right 
                information. This page is something that I would have loved to have in my early days of writing code.
                My vision is that developers from around the world can come here to get key information that I wish I had
                when I started my journey. Enjoy!
                <br>
                <h2><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="new">W3 Schools</a></h2>
                My favortie website for basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript information. This is a tab I usually keep open 
                while writing code and reference often. Most developers don't memorize all the info they need to do their
                jobs, but they do know where to find it. This is a great resource for basic formatting and sample code.
                <br>
                <h2><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="new">Stack Overflow</a></h2>
                This one is a little bit more for the advanced user. You'll typically find two types on here; beginners and 
                professionals. This site is great for problems that you can't figure out by yourself. I've reached out many times
                when I've gotten stuck on projects and get several responses from developers within hours. Make sure you do your 
                research. Most developers will not respond kindly if you are asking them to write your code. But if you've done your
                research, and tried several things, and show them your work, most are very helpful. Check it out when you get in a jam,
                but make sure you have done your due diligence first.
                <br>
                <h2><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="new">Mozilla Developer Network</a></h2>
                Aside from being a cool company, Mozilla offers this network for developers of all levels. This is a great resource by the 
                company that makes my favorite web browser and that values personal privacy on the web. Use the MDN for reference while
                writing code. Check out <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/" target="new">
                Firefox Developer Edition</a> too. This is a great browser with tons of great tools for web developers.

                <h2><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="new">Treehouse</a></h2>
                This site is a great learning tool. After my first introduction boot camp I began taking courses on Treehouse's 
                online school in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is the place where I found most of my JavaScript knowledge. Treehouse
                has a $30 monthly program where you can take unlimited virtual classes, be tested and create projects. The classes start 
                easy and progressively get more advanced. The nice part is that you can go back anytime and review lessons and work. 
                They even let you try it for free for 30 days. I'd recommend at least taking a trial, it's free!
                <h2><a href="https://github.com/" target="new">GitHub</a></h2>
                This is a repository site. A repository is a place where you can post code. You may want to use it as a back-up, or you
                may be working on a team of developers who all post to GitHub for a common project. GitHub has been the standard in repository 
                sites for a long time and was recently purchased by Microsoft. It's free to sign up for and there are some simple tutorials
                to help new users get familiarized. You can also use an IDE, or an integrated development environment, such as Visual Studio
                Code, to push (or back-up) code from your computer to your GitHub repository. Start an account today.
                <br>
                <h2><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="new">Visaul Studio Code</a></h2>
                This is a great (and let's not forget free) IDE. You can write code, run the console and push code directly to GitHub. A 
                slightly more advanced code editor, but surprisingly intuitive. It comes with most of the features you'd want already
                built in.
                <br>
                <h2><a href="https://atom.io/" target="new">Atom</a></h2>
                This one is a more basic code editor that is great for simple jobs or entry level developers. Atom is also free and has a huge
                library of open source mods you can install into it. The program runs smooth and I used it to successfully build my first 
                personal website. A great tool to have handy for any developer.
                <br>
                <h2><a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="new">MySQL</a></h2>
                This is an open-source relational database system that has a free version for download. The system includes a server
                and several tools for interacting with relational databases. It can help you write SQL queries or help you check the work
                while you progress. View your databases, manage them and access the wonderful world of data.
                <br>
                <h2><a href="https://codepen.io/#" target="new">CodePen</a></h2>
                CodePen is a great alternative to downloading a code editor on your machine. It has a great setup for front end developers
                which includes a HTML, CSS and JavaScript editor window complete with a functional developer console. You can write entire 
                web pages and save them for others to view. It has a social network feel and there are a lot of great CSS animations for 
                inspiration. Definitely worth a bookmark.
                <br>
                <h2><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="new">Postman</a></h2>
                This app is a great tool for web developers working with API based websites. Available for free download, you can 
                monitor your ports and examine the HTTP transmissions as well as view raw JSON data.
                <br>
                <h2><a href="http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/" target="new">Nashville Software School</a></h2>
                A non-profit boot camp in Nashville, Tennessee; this is where I began to advance my front-end developer career in 2017. They
                have a great website with a lot of free resources. If you're in the Nashville area, they offer a range of web developement
                courses that are a great value.
                <br>
                <h2><a href="http://logols.io/" target="new">Logols</a></h2>
                Logols is one of the best values I've found in boot camps. Based in Detroit and headed up by full-stack guru Joe Mackie,
                this boot camp employs a full-stack approach and is a great alternative to more expensive courses.
                <br>
                <h2><a href="https://wesbos.com/" target="new">Wes Bos</a></h2>
                Wes Bos is a developer who has a great learning and education site for developers of all levels. There are CSS tips and 
                a really valuable 30 day challenge for developers trying to up their game in basic JavaScript. The 30 projects will give you 
                a nice portfolio and teach you many tools in this powerful language, without any additonal libraries or frameworks.

                <h2><a href="http://jonibologna.com/content/images/flexboxsheet.pdf" target="new">FlexBox Cheat Sheet</a></h2>
                The Flex Box is one of CSS3's coolest features. This ability lets you easily format web pages using CSS and can be the difference
                in an eye catching, well-organized web page. I have used this cheat sheet for the past year and it's usually open while I'm formatting
                a web page in CSS. Download a copy and keep it handy for reference.
                <br>
                <h2><a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="new">Udemy</a></h2>
                This is a great online learning platform with a huge collection of short courses that have a lot of valuable information.
                I've taken a Data Science course on here and really enjoyed it. The course was only $10 and gives you the equivolent of 
                an online college course in terms of materials. Udemy is a great way to learn a new skill or prep for a project.
                <br>
                <h2><a href="https://www.tableau.com/" target="new">Tableau</a></h2>
                This is one of the coolest programs I've ever used. Download the free version and import an excel file, JSON file
                or a handful of other formats. The application is smart and makes you look like a presentation professional with little work. 
                For example, if you had a spreadsheet with customers, order amounts and zip codes, Tableau would recognize there is monetary data,
                geographical data and qualitative data and give you options to easily organize and categorize it. You could create a graph that 
                showed a US map, with measurements of how much money was spent by zip code. Definitely check this out if you plan to go into
                data science.
