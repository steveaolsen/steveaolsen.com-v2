            <h1>Must Have Resources</h1><br>
            <p>
                A big part of me growing as a developer is to help younger developers in thier quest for the right 
                information. This page is something that I would have loved to have in my early days of writing code.
                My vision is that developers from around the world can come here to get key information that I wish I had
                when I started my jourey. Enjoy!
                <br>
                <h2><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="new">W3 Schools</a></h2>
                My favortie web site for basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript information. This is a tab I usually keep open 
                while writing code and refernece often. Most developers don't memorize all the info they need to do thier
                jobs, but they do know where to find it. This is a great resource for basic formatting and sample code.
                <br>
                <h2><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="new">Stack Overflow</a></h2>
                This one is a little but more for the advanced user. You'll typicall find two types on here; beginners and 
                professionals. This site is great for problems that you can't figure out by yourself. I've reached out many times
                when I've got stuck on projects anf get several responses from developers within hours. Make sure you do your 
                research. Most developers will not respond kindly if you are asking them to write your code. But if you've done your
                research, and tried several things, and show them your work, most are very helpful. Check it out when you get in a jam,
                but make sure you have done your due diligence first.

                <h2><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="new">Mozilla Developer Network</a></h2>
                Aside from being a cool Company, Mozilla offers this network for developers of all levels. This is a great resource by the 
                company that makes my favorite web browser and that values personal privacy on the web. Use the MDN for reference while
                writing code. Check out <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/" target="new">
                Firefox Developer Edition Web Browser</a> too. This is a great browser with tons of great tools for web developers.

                <h2><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="new">Treehouse</a></h2>
                This site is a great learnign tool. After my first introduction bootcamp i began taking courses on treehouse's 
                online school in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is the place where I learned most of my JavaScript knowledge. Treehouse
                has a $30 monthly program where you can take unlimited virtual classes, be tested and create projects. The classes start 
                easy and progressively get more advanced. The nice part is that you can go back anytime and review lessons and work. 
                They even let you try it for free for 30 days. I'd recommend at least taking a trial, it's free!
                <h2><a href="https://github.com/steveaolsen" target="new">GitHub</a></h2>
                This is a repository site. A repository is a place where you can post code. You may want to use it as a back-up, or you
                may be working on a team of developers who all post to GitHub for a common project. GitHub has been the biggest repository 
                site for a long time and was recently purchased by Microsoft. It's free to sign up for and there are some simple tutorials
                to help new users get familiarized. You can also use an IDE, or an integrated development environment, such as Visaul Studio
                Code, to push (or back-up) code from your computer to your GitHub repository. Start an account today.
                <br>
                <h2><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="new">Visaul Studio Code</a></h2>
                This is a great (and let's not forget free) IDE. You can write code, run the console and push code directly to GitHub. A 
                slightly more advanced code writing suite, but suprisingly intuitive and comes with most of the features you'd want already
                built in.

                <h2><a href="https://atom.io/" target="new">Atom</a></h2>
                This one is a more basic code editor that is great for simple jobs or entry level developers. Atom is also free and has a huge
                library of open source mods you can install into it. the program runs smooth and I used it to sucessfully build my first 
                personal website. A great tool to have handy for any developer.
